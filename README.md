# Apprentice Chef Dataset

In this assignment, we were tasked with using the information in our course to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development. 

The assignment consists of two parts. The first part is to create different models for predicting the revenue generated from a customer. The second part is to create a business analysis using Jupytr. 

As of now, only the first part is complete where I created KNN, Lasso, OLS and ARD models. (The graphs have been commented out because a requirement for this assignment was speed). The whole notebook runs in 8 - 11 seconds. From the models created, the best scoring one was the ARD model with a training score of 0.7651 and a testing score of 0.7622.
